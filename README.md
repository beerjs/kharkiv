## Who are we waiting for, or can I join?

Literally, anyone, independently from place of work, place of living, sex, preferences or religion. Js - is all that matters.

There are two rules only: respect others and don't forget to pay for yourself in cafe.

## How to become a speaker

Just join us. Usually, we propose one-two topics before the meeting and someone takes role of speaker and prepares some material.

However, noone likes to prepare and often we just extemporize. As an option, two or more topics may be discussed at the same time.
